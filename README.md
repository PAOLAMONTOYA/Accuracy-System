# Accuracy Log
### A system created to log all errors that occur in the workplace across all departments in an effort continue to follow procedures, allow the Distribution Center to run more efficiently, and ensure all employees are treating fairly and held to the same stanadards.

#### Important information needed to pull:
- employee
- order number
- cost of damage
- images for proof
- record keeping of what disciplinary action employee is on

#### All saving, attachment of images, calculating of cost, and reset of contents in each cell is done in the same sheet. This is done by the macro enabled buttons that lead you to the correct file path.

#### The process should become more streamlined for the adminstators utilizing the sheet as everything is one click away with the same page. The process should also keep a cleaner log of errors that occur per month per employee and hope to reduce the amount of erorrs and costly damages.
